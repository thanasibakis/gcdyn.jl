## Documentation: `simulate-s5f-mutations`

Reads a list of sequences (separated by newlines) from stdin or a file passed as an argument, and runs a mutation process on each sequence for a fixed amount of time.
On one line per sequence, the details of each mutation are printed in the form "fromKD:duration:toKD".
Semicolons separate each mutation.

### Requirements

Tested on Python 3.9.
Requires that `lib/gcdyn` is installed from the repository root directory.
